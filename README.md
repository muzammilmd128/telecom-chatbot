Install required packages:
bash-
pip install flask flask-cors requests

Run the server:
bash-
python app.py

This project uses OpenRouter AI, which acts as a gateway to access large language models (LLMs).

Youâ€™ll need an API key from https://openrouter.ai
*

Limitations-
-Relies entirely on the LLM's ability to generate correct answers (may hallucinate)
-Requires internet connection to work (for API calls)
-Not trained on specific telecom datasets â€” it uses general knowledge

To Do / Future Improvements-
-Add telecom-specific FAQs
-Add support for multiple languages
-Deploy using services like Render or Railway
